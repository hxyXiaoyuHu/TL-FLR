This folder contains the code and data files necessary to implement the proposed methods and produce the results presented in the paper.

TL-FLR-FunFiles.R: contains R functions for implementing the proposed method

main-oracle-TL-FLR.R: generates results for Model (I) in the simulation studies

main-aggregation-TL-FLR.R: generates results for Models (II)&(III)&(IV) in the simulation studies 

financial.R: generates results corresponding to the real data

The Financial/ subfolder contains the preprocessed data used in the real data analysis.
